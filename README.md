# Quadrupedal_Robot
Welcome to the Quadrupedal Development Project! This repository will contain the code and documentation for building and programming a quadrupedal robot using Python, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a quadrupedal robot that can be controlled using a Raspberry Pi and ESP32 microcontrollers. The robot will perform basic movements such as walking, turning, and stopping, and can be further extended with additional functionalities.

This README will be updated as the project continues
